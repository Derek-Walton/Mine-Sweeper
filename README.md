# Python Minesweeper üí£

A __Minesweeper__ protoype written in __Python__ using John Zelle's __graphics.py__ (simple object oriented graphics library). This was a small side-project that lasted 2 weeks to apply and practise the skills I learned in the first half of my first teaching block in my first-year Programming module, at the University of Portsmouth.

## Overview

The primary objective of this side-project was to develop a working prototype of __Minesweeper__. The prototype needed to have an intuitive user interface and basic features such as flagging bombs, and clearing spaces with no bombs.

## Main Features

### Start Page

A fully interactive and intuitive start page where you can select the difficulty and the map size.

### Working Game üïπÔ∏è

Functioning minesweeper, where you can _clear_ and _flag_ spaces, see the _total number of mines_, and the _number of flags placed_.

#### Placing Flags

#### Cleared Game

### Different Game Sizes and Difficulty

Functioning game size settings with a set size of __easy__: 10 x 10, __medium__: 20 x 20 and __hard__: 30 x 30. The different difficulty settings were determined by the chance of a space having a mine, __easy__: 15%, __medium__: 20% and __hard__: 25%.

#### Difficulty: Easy, Size: Large

## Requirements

* Python 3
* graphics.py

This project utilises John Zelle's __graphics.py__ library. Please ensure this is in the same directory as the __mineSweeper.py__ for the Minesweeper to function properly.

## Usage

1. Clone this project
2. Run [__mineSweeper.py__](./mineSweeper.py)
3. Choose your difficulty and size

### Note

This is project is still __unfinished__ with some features still missing such as, a win window, a way of keeping track of previous attempts, etc.
